# ♻️ LA LIGNE VERTE  

**La population est-elle suffisamment impliquée dans la gestion de son cadre de vie ?**  

**La Ligne Verte** ( Greenline) is an **open-source civic and clean tech project** by **GreenPill Côte d’Ivoire**.  
We empower citizens to **map, clean, and regenerate** their neighborhoods while earning **Himpact points** for their contributions.  

Our motto:  
👉 *“Rends ton quartier Zo et prends tes points.”* (Make your neighborhood cool and earn your points)

## ✨ WHAT IS LA LIGNE VERTE?  

La Ligne Verte is a **participatory mapping platform** that transforms urban sanitation into a community-driven mission.  

- Citizens report unsanitary zones using **Debora**, our Telegram (and soon WhatsApp) chatbot.  
- Reports are validated and published on an **open-source map**.  
- Contributors earn **Himpact points** (a tokenized reward system on Celo) exchangeable for airtime, vouchers, and other benefits.  

By combining **citizen engagement**, **open environmental data**, and **regenerative incentives**, La Ligne Verte turns waste problems into opportunities.
